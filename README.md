ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning ðŸŒ¸

In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of machine learning with Python, focusing on the elegant Iris flower dataset. Our objective? To classify Iris flowers with precision using the power of scikit-learn.

ðŸŒ¿ Algorithms in Action ðŸŒ¿

We've harnessed the following machine learning algorithms to predict and achieve outstanding accuracy in our Iris project:

Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based model that carves its path to accurate predictions.

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classifier: Trust your neighbors to identify the Iris species.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful algorithm that defines decision boundaries with finesse.

Logistic Regression: A classic choice for binary classification tasks.

Metrics: We've meticulously evaluated our models using essential metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score.

Train-Test Split: Separating the data into training and testing sets for robust model validation.
